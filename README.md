# GoProFileNameFix
Tool to fix the GoPro file naming convention.


This GoPro page, explains it all: https://community.gopro.com/s/article/GoPro-Camera-File-Naming-Convention?language=en_US
I'm pretty sure that the guys who designed this convention never used a GoPro filming with chapters.
This tool fixes the 'zzxxxx' dumb filename composition, swapping and renaming the files to 'xxxxzz'.
This way, you'll have the files ordered by file number ('xxxx'), then chapter('zz').

There are two versions: a windows console and a Windows forms application.
The code is pretty simple, you can port/change/upgrade/fix/eat it, has you like.
